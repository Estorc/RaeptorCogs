Welcome to the official documentation for **RaeptorCogs**, a free and open-source graphic and physics framework designed
for creating 2D and 3D apps using C++. It is used as base for the Raeptor Engine series, a collection of game engines
focused on performance and ease of use – completing the original idea of **RTBE (Raeptor Turn-based Engine)**, a
concept of turn-based RPG game engine.

This documentation provides comprehensive information about the features, installation, and usage of RaeptorCogs.
We recommend starting with the :doc:`about/introduction` section to get an overview of what the
documentation covers.
