============

This so called "Getting Started" section provides an overview of RaeptorCogs and guides

It is recommended for new users to begin here to familiarize themselves with the framework's

`examples/demo/src <https://github.com/Estorc/RaeptorCogs/tree/main/examples/demo/src>`_ folder of
the repository).:
